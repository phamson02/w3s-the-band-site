# W3School's Band Template Webisite Clone

Clone site: https://phamson02.github.io/w3s-the-band-site/

I recreated the band template site of W3Schools as part of a project in the introductory course to HTML and CSS at [F8](https://fullstack.edu.vn). One tiny change that I did to the site is in the mobile the navigation bar as shown below.

<p align="middle" float="left">
  <img src="/demo/my-nav-bar.png" width="40%" />
  <img src="/demo/w3s-nav-bar.png" width="40%" /> 
</p>
<p align="middle" float="left">
  <img src="/demo/my-expanded-nav-bar.png" width="40%" />
  <img align="top"src="/demo/w3s-expanded-nav-bar.png" width="40%" /> 
</p>
<div align="middle" text-align="center" display="inline-block">
  <b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMy site &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp</b>
  <b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspW3Schools' site</b>
</div>

## Acknowledgements

This project was mainly instructed by Đặng Ngọc Sơn in his excellent introductory course to HTML and CSS at [F8](https://fullstack.edu.vn).

The site I made in this project is a clone of [W3Schools' Band Template Webisite](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/band_template.htm).
