# W3School's Band Template Webisite Clone

Clone site: https://phamson02.github.io/w3s-the-band-site/

I recreated the band template site of W3Schools as part of a project in the introductory course to HTML and CSS at [F8](https://fullstack.edu.vn). One tiny change that I did to the site is in the mobile the navigation bar as shown below.

My navigation bar on the left preserve the search button as compared to the original bar.

<p align="middle" float="left">
  <img src="/demo/my-nav-bar.png" width="40%" />
  <img src="/demo/w3s-nav-bar.png" width="40%" /> 
</p>
<p align="middle" float="left">
  <img src="/demo/my-expanded-nav-bar.png" width="40%" />
  <img align="top"src="/demo/w3s-expanded-nav-bar.png" width="40%" /> 
</p>
